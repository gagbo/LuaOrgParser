#+TITLE: LuaOrgParser
#+AUTHOR: Gerry Agbobada

* Purpose
  This is a simple org-mode file parser written in Lua. The hidden objective
  is to later try to embed a library like this in neovim to help everyone
  work with Org-mode files in the editor.

* Dependencies
  - Lua 5.1 :: since the end goal is to embed it in
    [[https://github.com/neovim/neovim][Neovim]] and Neovim bundles lua5.1
    for all its integrations
  - LPegLJ :: the main working tool in the stack, to take the org grammar and
    parse files / strings with the given information
  - LuaUnit :: it is bundled in the [[./tests][tests]] folder

* Specification used
   The [[./doc/spec/org-syntax-worg.org][spec]] used has been extracted from
   worg and can be found
   [[https://orgmode.org/worg/dev/org-syntax.html][here]].

* TODO Roadmap [0/4]
** TODO Unit test framework [1/2]
*** DONE Install Lua Unit
*** TODO Add test files with increasing amount of features
** TODO Bland implementation
** TODO Parse all syntax from "spec" [0/6]
*** TODO Parse headlines
*** TODO Parse #+ blocks
*** TODO Parse tables
*** TODO Parse properties and other drawers
*** TODO Parse timestamps
*** TODO Parse text markups
** TODO Make the grammar dynamic
   A few keywords in the grammar should be customizable at least before a
   string / file is parsed.
